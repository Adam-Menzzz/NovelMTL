All three brothers have advanced to the top 32. In the next match, Zhang Zhengxiong will face Zhang Family's Zhang Xingyu, who is Zhang Wenyuan's closed-door disciple. Lin Le will battle Qin Yunlong, and Ye Cang will take on Flame Emperor.

Ye Cang, holding a grilled skewer, took a bite and smirked at Flame Emperor from the edge of the ring. "This isn't a game, you know. You can't beat me, and you don't stand a chance..."

"I know..." Flame Emperor had just witnessed the scene of Frieza's battle with Son Goku. He realized that the amount of inner energy he possessed couldn't compare, but would he not go all out in this battle? Faint white flames of inner energy began to emanate from him, forming a white flaming dragon shadow that occasionally roared and growled.

"The Nine Transformations of the Flame Dragon - Third Transformation: Dragon Flame. This is the crucial aspect of the Nine Transformations of the Flame Dragon. Everything else builds upon this..." Qin San, familiar with the Li family's martial arts, glanced at Li Kefeng, the current head of the Li family, recalling their youthful days of competing in the Ten Families Martial Arts Competition.

Ye Cang watched Flame Emperor's Dragon Flame transformation and raised his hand, launching a Plasma Lightning Fist. Flame Emperor continuously used his Flame Dragon Inner Qi to defend while launching surprise attacks at Ye Cang.

Ye Cang, seemingly unbothered by Flame Emperor's aggressive moves, slowly extended his hand once more. Despite Flame Emperor's attempts to disrupt his rhythm, Ye Cang's hand and finger lightly touched the dragon's head and fist. The dragon's roar became meaningless as it couldn't advance, and Ye Cang delivered a precise punch, akin to a sniper's headshot, sending Flame Emperor flying.

Yu Lichun furrowed her brow as she observed this incredible display of power. She wondered why someone of such strength would even bother with a martial arts competition. She glanced at Qin Zhong, who was wearing a mischievous grin. Surely, he was involved in this somehow.

Su Yanxing wasn't clear about Ye Cang's identity, but she knew he had a close relationship with Lin Liang and others. Could it be that his age is wrong? If this is the case, Senior Lin Liang's character will definitely not allow it. Do you want to recommend him to Absolute Sword in the end? Su Yanxing looked at Lin Liang, who shook his head and said, "He won't go there. Everyone in the Heavenly Sword Sect, except for Lin Lan, has suffered because of him."

Su Yanxing was stunned by Lin Liang's words. All members of the Lin family in the Heavenly Sword Sect, except for the Grand Sword Emperor Lin Lan, had suffered because of Ye Cang... She knew Lin Liang wouldn't lie, and given Ye Cang's age, he was undoubtedly a remarkable talent.

Among those present, only the two old kings, her husband, and a few younger juniors were discernible to Su Yanxing. She couldn't read anyone else. As for the Captain XV, although he had extraordinary talent for someone his age, his abilities couldn't compare to the likes of Liu and Cao from the older generation. Yet, he was their leader, and even Lin Liang respected him greatly. Could he have a significant background? Su Yanxing thought so, but if Ye Cang and the others knew, they would shake their heads. Captain XV was just their leader in their group, which pretended to be adventurers but was actually a male Five Poisons cult that indulged in various vices.

Suddenly, Lin Liang sensed a powerful aura approaching. Looking at the night sky, a red glow drew closer. Su Yanxing furrowed her brow. "Senior sister? She's really here. Husband, stand behind me and keep your distance. My senior sister has some... peculiar habits. I'm afraid she might harm you."

Old Li, bewildered by the situation, watched the approaching red glow. He glanced at his cleaver, then at his wife, wondering why the heavens were playing such tricks on him.

Ye Cang, on the other hand, continued grilling his skewers, ignoring the commotion. He cut a slice of Blood Crystal Tomato, skewered it, and took a bite, savoring the flavor.

Old Li, still puzzled, asked weakly, "Can you defeat your senior sister?"

Su Yanxing replied, "It's about 50-50. She's at the ninth level, while I'm only at the first. But I do have some tricks up my sleeve."

Old Li was left speechless, realizing that his chances were slim.

"Humph, don't worry, Old Li. Whoever dares to harm you will have to get past my Blade and Bow first!" Huang Zhong, known for his skill in making whipped tendons, snorted coldly. He stood up, removed his shirt, revealing his muscular upper body and a dazzling sun tattoo. He gazed at the sky, as if declaring his dominance. "Old Li, just say the word, and I'll make that red glow in the sky disappear forever."

Su Yanxing looked at Huang Zhong's imposing manner, but when she looked at Lin Liang, she sighed and remained silent. Moreover, a terrifying spiritual power overwhelmed her, preventing her from daring to lift her head to look at the tattoo behind him, as if it were some kind of supreme totem.

Huang Zhong's anger made the surrounding air extremely dry and scorching. Golden spiritual power surged from his body, and his head and beard began to flutter. His eyes were like two blazing suns.

"Old General, calm down," Lin Liang hastily advised, while Old Li shook his head. "Thank you for your kind intentions, Huang Xiong. Let's just watch."

The elders of the Ten Families Martial Arts Tournament, including Yu Lichun, Li Yuanlong, and others, were all subdued by this power that had not yet fully revealed itself. It was terrifying, immense, pure, and overwhelming. It felt as if a giant sun god were facing them with eyes that didn't even acknowledge their presence.

Huang Zhong shrugged and relaxed his body and power. "Since you all insist, let's watch then."

Lin Liang sighed at Huang Zhong's antics, knowing that nobody here was his match. Of course, if the Meng De, and Zhong Mou joined forces, they might stand a chance.

"Little Huang, don't be so impulsive. How many times have I told you? Be steady. Over there, just watch first. Don't rush. Remember what happened yesterday? We suffered greatly because of your impulsiveness. Don't you learn from your mistakes?" XV pressed down on Huang Zhong to make him sit. Huang Zhong, feeling embarrassed, rubbed his beard. "Oh, I understand now, Lord."

"Oh, Lord's words of wisdom. I gain so much every day from listening to your teachings. I fear the day I can't hear your guidance every day. How regrettable that would be," Jia Xu's words sent shivers down everyone's spine. XV, in particular, had goosebumps all over and felt his butt clenching involuntarily.

"Wow, Cousin Jia's words are so disgusting I can hardly stand it," Wu Na shivered from the cheesiness.

"Look, you have half of your relatives' sweet talk in you. I don't know how I've put up with so much," Thorny Rose elbowed Ye Cang.

"Shut up... you crazy criminal..." Ye Cang's words caused Thorny Rose to bite him on the face.

"Nana, call the police! Arrest this person who's obsessed with me! I'll forgive you for being an accomplice!" Ye Cang gasped for breath as Wu Na laughed and quietly moved away, joining Frozen Cloud to watch Zhang Zhengxiong's battle with Zhang Xingyu.

Lin Liang turned to look at a slightly petite figure approaching, barely reaching 1.7 meters, wearing street-style clothing and a duckbill cap. Could it be Lan'er? Beside him, Songyin was dressed more professionally but seemed troubled as she covered her forehead. This was turning into quite the spectacle...
