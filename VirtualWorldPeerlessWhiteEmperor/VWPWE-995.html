    <h1>Chapter 995</h1>
    <div class ="chapter" id="chapter">Ye Cang stepped down from the arena, waiting for the next round's assignment. During this time, he and Ye Wushuang pretended to watch other arenas. They coincidentally stood together, seemingly discussing information on the stage. Those who knew Ye Cang's rather malicious nature, such as Thorny Rose and Wu Na, could detect the faint scent of deception.

"Wow, my son-in-law has a lot of contacts. He even knows people from the Black Cloud Sect..." observed Qin San, looking at the embroidered badge on Ye Wushuang's arm, showing three black clouds covering the sun.

"Is the Black Cloud Sect strong?" asked Thorny Rose.

"They used to be alright, but after a terrifying attack from the Saviors, they were almost wiped out. Only a few lucky disciples and an elder survived. That elder lost a hand, a leg, and an eye. Now they're a fading sect on the brink of extinction. Still, they participate in events like this as per the initial invitations. I thought they might have vanished, but it seems they've really come this time... and it's a young girl," Qin San's words left Thorny Rose and her companions somewhat awkward.

Meanwhile, seemingly discussing the arena's participants, Ye Cang and Ye Wushuang's conversation went as follows.

"Black Cloud Sect? Quite a reach for someone like you who can be ruthless to others. Even Elder Duan is in such a state... You're a disgrace to the Dragon Group."

"Big Brother, we've faced life and death together several times. Can't you tone it down a bit? Besides, I just happened to pass by to see how they're doing lately. It's really sad. I then learned they received an invitation to the Ten Martial Arts Tournament. So, I discussed it with Elder Duan and decided to help them revive the Black Cloud Sect in the role of Deputy Sect Leader."

"Enough with the talk, you little brat. You're a disgrace to the Dragon Group."

"..., you have no right to criticize me , you scum who steals wallets."

"I hate losing..."

"Then let's call it a draw."

"That's fine, but I want this amount..." Seven fingers.

"You bastard... Ahem, you're all white on the outside but black on the inside. Maximum this amount. Remember, you should pity me, your little sister. I haven't had a good lunch in two months." Three fingers.

"Add another 10%, or I'll report you for various reasons."

"You... Fine, 40% then."

Ye Wushuang's lively eyes showed a hint of annoyance. This guy... The whiter the fur, the blacker the heart...

They secretly exchanged hand signals to confirm the success of their deal, signifying the agreement was in effect. Then, they politely smiled at each other and returned to their respective sides of the arena, behaving like gentlemen, a casual interaction among disciples from different sects.

"Ye Wushuang... The little bastard..." muttered Cold Moon. Qin San, who happened to be nearby, asked in a low voice, "Does Miss Cold Moon know her?"

"Yes, she's from the Dragon Group."

"...?" Qin San was taken aback, then he smiled wryly and looked at Ye Cang returning, "Ye Wushuang, is this someone from the Dragon Group?"

"Yes, she's the Vice Leader of the First Group and temporarily taking charge of the Ninth Group. This brat wants to fix a fake match. Sigh, a disgrace to the Dragon Group..."

"...?" Qin San was speechless. "How did you respond?"

"I agreed. She'll split the earnings with me, making it a draw."

Qin San glanced at Ye Cang's chest, then said sarcastically, "You still have the nerve to criticize others!? Wait a minute, I guess I'm not really in a position to say anything about him..."

Ye Wushuang watched Ye Cang and recalled his terrifying skills. The fatal wound through Dragon Lady's chest was his doing. Many times during missions, she had witnessed that heart-stopping wound on her chest, a sight that haunted her. Her thoughts also wandered to the night of the Annos Extermination Battle, a night of heavy casualties.

Especially when she held the rear guard position, blood dripping down her eyes, she saw a more terrifying starving wolf in the crimson world. White fur and a sea of blood. at dawn, in the blood-drenched mansion, not a single living creature remained. Not a single complete corpse. The grapevines were dyed red with blood, the soil irrigated with blood. Although she joined the Dragon Group with the understanding that she might give her life for China, the feeling of the first light falling into her hands through the blood-stained grapevines was one of being alive, victorious, a part of the Dragon Group. Tears of joy rolled down her face, staining her dried blood stains, but more so, it was an extreme sorrow. Old Xie, who saved her, wouldn't return anymore.

Throughout that night, there was no trace of theatricality, only flailing limbs and blood. It was the Annos Battle that made her one of the Dragon Group's core members, second only to Dragon Lady. Among the members who went to the Annos mansion, only a few survived, and among them were Ye Cang, who happened to be in the Dragon Group's mission, and her. Despite her reluctance, she had no choice but to become a group leader. Unbeknownst to her, she had already become a 'senior' in the new generation, second only to the Dragon Lady. The most frustrating part was that being the temporary Ninth Group leader wouldn't give her any extra salary or allowance! The money spent on KTV each month was barely enough...

Ye Cang also looked over at Ye Wushuang. This girl is the successor designated by Dragon Lady. If Dragon Lady were to die, she would become the next leader of the Dragon Group. The extent of her psychic abilities and courage can only be experienced. It was only when the Anos family wiped out her consciousness that she could see it. At that time, shortly after graduating from elementary school, she volunteered to stay behind and break through, and when I looked back at her again, she was already covered in red. There was no other color on her body, just blood plasma and flesh. Big Brother Xie Zhongyong stayed behind with her, sacrificing himself to save her. Because of this, she pays Xie Yuer her living expenses every month, almost to the limit of what she can afford. Regardless of whether the other party accepts it or not, it's because she was Xie Zhongyong's confidant. Big Brother Xie is almost equivalent to her father, and their relationship is beyond ordinary. Even Sword Dragon feels that their relationship is either father-daughter or an unconventional romantic relationship... At least, that was the case before Xie Zhongyong's death in the Annos Battle.

Afternoon battles came to an end quickly, and it was time for dinner. Just as Ye Cang was about to enjoy the meal, Old Wang arrived. He sampled the current level of Qianzhen Pavilion's culinary skills and looked at the direction of smoke with a complicated expression. "Master Qian, it's truly a pity. Your Eight-Character True Mantra, which involves infusing taste with heart and starting taste with ingredients, didn't get properly passed down..."

Old Wang took out ingredients he brought from the Linhai Azure Heaven Manor and started preparing a hotpot. The aroma wafted through the air, making everyone's mouths water. Even Su Yanxing couldn't help but feel her saliva glands become active. Mutton? Mushrooms? And... those are crabs?

Ye Wushuang grabbed a bowl and chopsticks and sat next to Ye Cang. "Big Brother, it smells so good. Can I have some?"

"No, you can't. Get lost..." Ye Cang gave her a glance.

"..." Ye Wushuang didn't care and directly started picking the meat in front of Ye Cang to cook in the hotpot. Ye Cang shot her a white-eyed glance. "Just cook it briefly a couple of times; otherwise, it'll get overcooked."</div>
