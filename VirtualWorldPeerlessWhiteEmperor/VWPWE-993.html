    <h1>Chapter 993</h1>
    <div class ="chapter" id="chapter">Ye Cang stepped onto the arena and looked at the young man from the Zhong family before him. This guy had delicate features and was about the same age as him. He somewhat resembled that scoundrel. Ye Cang showed a friendly smile and said, "Brother, your surname is Zhong, right?"

"Yes, that's correct. I'm Zhong Yunxiao." Zhong Yunxiao had a favorable impression of Ye Cang. He seemed to be a refined person.

In his mind, Ye Cang thought, So you want to play a prank on me? You think my cooking is terrible? That guy is probably one of your ancestors. Don't blame me then...

Ye Cang looked at Zhong Yunxiao, who still had a smiling and kind expression, and cupped his fists, saying, "Brother, please go easy on me."

"Let's both display what we've learned. That's the meaning of this martial arts competition, Brother Ye." Zhong Yunxiao started to circulate his energy. In the blink of an eye, Ye Cang was already in front of him. His chest felt tight, and he was sent flying off the arena. However, Ye Cang wasn't about to let him leave the arena so easily. With a swift step, he moved like white lightning, grabbing Zhong Yunxiao's ankle and pulling him back onto the platform. At this point, his friendly smile began to intensify, turning into a chilling sensation. Ye Cang murmured, "I won't let you leave so easily... You dare to play tricks on me?"

Zhong Yunxiao suddenly realized that he was no match for this person. He couldn't predict his attacks or movements, and he couldn't even gauge his speed. Even if he could see them, his reactions were lacking. It was truly terrifying. Ye Cang used his index finger to continuously tap his body. Then, he interlocked his ten fingers and slowly exerted force to bend Zhong Yunxiao's body. Once all his joints were broken, Ye Cang used intense pain treatment energy to repair them. Zhong Yunxiao was in so much pain that he wanted to scream, but he managed to stifle it. This surprised Ye Cang. Most people who experienced this technique ended up screaming like pigs being slaughtered. Could it be that the pain wasn't enough? He once again broke his joints with great force and twisted them in the wrong direction.

Zhong Yunxiao's mouth opened, almost letting out a scream, but he held back. Ye Cang restored him again. Zhong Yunxiao attempted to withdraw his hands with all his strength, but Ye Cang's hands were like a pair of pliers clamping onto him, and his knee strikes felt like hitting steel plates. He didn't even attempt to dodge them. Ye Cang looked at Zhong Yunxiao's determined eyes as he resisted the pain. Ye Cang finally let go of his hands and stepped back a few steps. "I apologize. Seeing you reminded me of someone unpleasant... I couldn't help myself."

Outside the arena, especially the Zhong family, their expressions turned grim. They looked towards the Qin family's side. How shameless, this person's displayed speed was beyond what the younger generation could handle. Qin Zhong and Qin San ignored the disdainful gazes, sipping tea in peace.

Zhong Yunxiao felt quite aggrieved. This guy saw through that he reminded him of someone unpleasant. Without a second word, he unleashed his strongest inner energy, the Great Sea Infinite Yuan Qi, powerful and heavy as a descending mountain tiger. Ye Cang casually extended his hand, placing a finger on his palm. With a heavy palm strike accompanied by a muffled sound, Zhong Yunxiao's hand couldn't move forward a bit.

Zhong Yunxiao felt a wave of frustration. Was this the gap between them?

Zhang Zhengxiong had already defeated his opponent in seconds. Seeing the expressions of Ye Cang and Zhong Yunxiao, he thought about it. My brother can block anti-metal bullets with his fingers, not because he can't pierce them, but because of skill and strength. I've also learned this technique, and I can use it to deter opponents from targeting my weak points.

"I concede," Zhong Yunxiao wasn't someone who couldn't accept defeat. "Brother Ye, you're skilled."

He continued, "I wasn't even able to make you use the Eight Trigrams Yin-Yang technique."

Ye Cang felt embarrassed. I don't even know how to use that. "Brother Zhong, you're doing well. It's just that we're simply not on the same level."

Ye Cang looked at Zhong Yunxiao's figure and couldn't help but think of Zhong Mojie, this kid must be his ancestor. "I shouldn't have participated in this in the first place. It's just out of consideration for others."

Zhong Yunxiao looked at Ye Cang's sincere smile and didn't say much. "I hope to learn more from Brother Ye another day."

Ye Cang nodded and watched his departing figure thoughtfully.

-----------------------------------------------

In another multi-dimensional world...

Mojie was in a cave-like place, looking serious as he examined the latest issue of a humorous serial publication. He adjusted the backpack full of materials on his back. "Alright, it's time to go back. Jasmine is still waiting for me."

In the side courtyard living room of Xuanqing Monastery in the Holy Gospel, a young girl was setting up bowls and chopsticks on the dining table. At this moment, Zhong Mojie returned. "Brother, today, I found this in Dad's relic box! The family genealogy."

Mojie simply nodded, his tone like an older brother, "Let's talk about it after dinner."

For his parents, Zhong Mojie looked at Jasmine's back as she served the food. She probably doesn't remember them. When they lost contact during the expedition to Cloud Tower, she was only three years old. Flipping through that old booklet, he had seen it before. His and Lily's names were at the end. Flipping through to before the Great Collapse, everything was normal. They belonged to a big family - Zhong Yunxiao, Zhong Xingtong. There was no adding of surnames from the maternal side. After putting the booklet down, he looked at the girl's left hand with the metal frame and joint, feeling somewhat guilty. Memories of the battle where the Saintess perished rushed back, along with the severed heads and limbs of his comrades, the fall of the Saintess, and his own lost left eye... and the lost right hand.

Mojie reached out and took the bowls and chopsticks, using his slender fingers to clip the dishes. The girl's dexterous hand held the chopsticks, and the mechanical right hand put down the dishes. "Where's Zhang old man?"

"Grandpa Zhang said someone asked him to set up an altar to summon the Xuanqing Ancestor to dispel evil. Also, Miss Charlotte from the street will be getting married tomorrow. She hopes to hold the wedding in our church, so I took it for you." Jasmine smiled.

"Okay, I'll handle that. Finish your meal quickly and practice your swordsmanship afterward. I'll supervise you." Mojie nodded.

"Brother, at school today..."

"Jasmine, no talking while eating. Eat your food properly."

"Oh... you were the one who asked first." Jasmine muttered the last sentence softly, then began eating quietly.

Although the siblings didn't speak for a long time, the scene of them feeding each other was heartwarming.

-----------------------------------------------

Zhong Yunxiao returned to his spot. The elders didn't blame him; instead, they praised his patience and perseverance. This made him feel even more guilty. He was just too useless.

On Lin Le's side, he faced off against a young prodigy from the Tang Sect. However, this young prodigy was now crying out in pain with a wolf repellent spray in his eyes and steel needles sticking into his buttocks like a hedgehog. Lin Le sighed, "Using flying knives in front of Lele, even the so-called Grand Witch and Guan Gong playing with small knives... In short, you're a piece of sh*t... You should go back and practice more. Although it might not be very effective."

"Qin San, you got yourself a great disciple. This is how low he stoops!" Tang Yishan, the third elder of the Tang family, exclaimed in anger.

"Wow, both using covert weapons, and now that you've lost, you blame someone else for being low...," Qin San retorted.

"You!" Tang Yishan frowned, while Qin's father ignored the confrontation and praised Lin Le's adaptability.</div>
